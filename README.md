# Motion-capture-system-for-safe-human-robot-interaction

The proposed system comprises three distinct components:
1) a tracking unit consisting of a computer and a camera that continuously captures a live video stream of the workspace;
2) a wearable robot, dubbed ArUcoGlide, that adjusts its orientation to ensure the visibility of the ArUco marker and to address occlusion by objects within the environment, with the additional functionality of providing haptic feedback in the event of a hazardous situation;
3) a collision avoidance controller that governs the movement of the robot, which in our case is a 6 DoF collaborative robot UR10, to avoid potential collisions with the userâ€™s hand in the workspace.

The system is to be used in warehouses and labs where to incrase user safty during collaborative tasks between robots and the human. The figure below shows a simple scenario of the usage of the system and its main components.
